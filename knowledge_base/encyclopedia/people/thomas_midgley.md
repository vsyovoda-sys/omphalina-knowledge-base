## 摘要

Thomas Midgley Jr. (May 18, 1889 – November 2, 1944) was an American mechanical and chemical engineer. He played a major role in developing leaded gasoline (tetraethyl lead) and some of the first chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), better known in the United States by the brand name Freon; both products were later banned from common use due to their harmful impact on human health and the environment. He was granted more than 100 patents over the course of his career.
Midgley contracted polio in 1940 and was left disabled; in 1944, he was found strangled to death by a device he devised to allow him to get out of bed unassisted. It is often reported that he had been accidentally killed by his own invention, but his death was declared by the coroner to be a suicide.
While the harmful effects of CFCs were not appreciated until decades after Midgley's death, tetraethyl lead was known to be acutely toxic by those involved in the development of leaded gasoline. This included Midgley, who publicly insisted that there was nonetheless no health hazard posed by the use of leaded gasoline in internal combustion engines.

**中文摘要:**
小托马斯·米基利（英語：Thomas Midgley Jr.，1889年5月18日—1944年11月2日），美国机械工程师和化学家，因研發对當代具有巨大貢獻以及污染之四乙基铅和氟利昂而闻名于世。
虽然米基利在世时得到了很多赞誉，他发明的产品四乙基铅和氟利昂性能优良，被大量使用，但后来这两种物质对环境和人体健康的巨大破坏作用逐渐显现，先后被限制使用和停用，這都已經是他死後30年的事了，而每天接觸鉛化合物的他本人也深受其害。因而其一生化工成就被後世媒體評為「令人遺憾的驚世天賦」。米基利因此被環境歷史學家約翰·R·麥克尼爾称为“ 對地球造成最大破壞的單個有機體”。

## 英文全文

## Early life

Thomas Midgley Jr. was born in Beaver Falls,  Pennsylvania on May 18, 1889, the son of Hattie Louise (née Emerson) (1865–1950) and Thomas Midgley Sr. (1840–1934). His family had a history of inventing; his father was an inventor in the field of automobile tires while his maternal grandfather, James Emerson, invented the inserted tooth saw. He grew up in Columbus,  Ohio and graduated from Cornell University in 1911 with a degree in mechanical engineering.
Early on, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances. In high school, he used the chewed bark of slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up. Later in life, he was known to always carry a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention.

## Career


### Leaded gasoline

In 1916, Midgley began working at General Motors. In December 1921, while working under the direction of Charles Kettering at Dayton Research Laboratories, a subsidiary of General Motors, he discovered (after discarding tellurium due to the difficult-to-eradicate smell) that the addition of tetraethyllead (TEL) to gasoline prevented knocking in internal combustion engines. The company named the substance "Ethyl", avoiding all mention of lead in reports and advertising. Oil companies and automobile manufacturers (especially General Motors, which owned the patent jointly filed by Kettering and Midgley) promoted the TEL additive as an inexpensive alternative superior to ethanol or ethanol-blended fuels, on which they could make very little profit. In December 1922, the American Chemical Society awarded Midgley the 1923 Nichols Medal for the "Use of Anti-Knock Compounds in Motor Fuels". This was the first of several major awards he earned during his career.
In 1923, Midgley took a long vacation in Miami to cure himself of lead poisoning. He said, "I find that my lungs have been affected and that it is necessary to drop all work and get a large supply of fresh air." That year, General Motors created the General Motors Chemical Company (GMCC) to supervise the production of TEL by the DuPont company. Kettering was elected as president with Midgley as vice president. However, after two deaths and several cases of lead poisoning at the TEL prototype plant in Dayton, Ohio, the staff at Dayton was said in 1924 to be "depressed to the point of considering giving up the whole tetraethyl lead program". Over the course of the next year, eight more people died at DuPont's plant in Deepwater, New Jersey. In 1924, dissatisfied with the speed of DuPont's TEL production using the "bromide process", General Motors and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now known as ExxonMobil) created the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce and market TEL. Ethyl Corporation built a new chemical plant using a high-temperature ethyl chloride process at the Bayway Refinery in New Jersey. However, within the first two months of its operation, the new plant was plagued by more cases of lead poisoning, hallucinations, insanity, and five deaths.
The risks associated with exposure to lead have been known at least since the 2nd century BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Midgley experienced lead poisoning himself, and was warned about the risk of lead poisoning from TEL as early as 1922. Midgley well knew the hazards of lead.  He investigated whether the risks, both in production and use, could be managed. Testing on the exhaust was completed, which he used to support the idea that 1 part tetraethyl lead per 1300 of gasoline could safely be used.  After the initial worker exposures, controls were developed to allow the process to operate safely. Leaded gasoline use grew exponentially. The cumulative chronic impacts of environmental lead were grossly underestimated.
On October 30, 1924, Midgley participated in a press conference to demonstrate the apparent safety of TEL, in which he poured TEL over his hands, placed a bottle of the chemical under his nose, and inhaled its vapor for sixty seconds, declaring that he could do this every day without succumbing to any problems. However, the state of New Jersey ordered the Bayway plant to be closed a few days later, and Jersey Standard was forbidden to manufacture TEL again without state permission. Production was restarted in 1926 after intervention by the federal government. High-octane fuel, enabled by lead, was important to the military. Midgley later took a leave of absence from work after being diagnosed with lead poisoning.  He was relieved of his position as vice president of GMCC in April 1925, reportedly due to his inexperience in organizational matters, but he remained an employee of General Motors.

### Freon

In the late 1920s, air conditioning and refrigeration systems employed compounds such as ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), propane, methyl formate (HCO2CH3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as refrigerants. Though effective, these were toxic, flammable, or explosive. The Frigidaire division of General Motors, at that time a leading manufacturer of such systems, sought a non-toxic, non-flammable alternative to these refrigerants.
Midgley, working with Albert Leon Henne, soon narrowed his focus to alkyl halides (the combination of carbon chains and halogens), which were known to be highly volatile (a requirement for a refrigerant) and also chemically inert. They eventually settled on the concept of incorporating fluorine into a hydrocarbon. They rejected the assumption that such compounds would be toxic, believing that the stability of the carbon–fluorine bond would be sufficient to prevent the release of hydrogen fluoride or other potential breakdown products. The team eventually synthesized dichlorodifluoromethane, the first chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), which they named "Freon".  This compound is more commonly referred to today as "Freon 12", or "R12".
Freon and other CFCs soon largely replaced other refrigerants, but also had other applications. A notable example was their use as a propellant in aerosol products and asthma inhalers. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded Midgley the Perkin Medal in 1937 for this work. In 1941, the American Chemical Society gave Midgley its highest award, the Priestley Medal. This was followed by the Willard Gibbs Award in 1942. He also held two honorary degrees and was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 1944, he was elected president and chairman of the American Chemical Society.

## Death

In 1940, at the age of 51, Midgley contracted polio and was left severely disabled. He devised an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to lift himself out of bed. On November 2, 1944, at the age of 55, he was found dead at his home in Worthington, Ohio. He had been killed by his own device after he became entangled in it and died of strangulation. His death was ruled a suicide by the coroner.
He left behind a widow, Carrie M. Reynolds from Delaware, Ohio, whom he had married on August 3, 1911.

## Legacy

Midgley's legacy is tied in with the negative environmental impact of leaded gasoline and freon. Environmental historian J. R. McNeill opined that Midgley "had more adverse impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history", and Bill Bryson remarked that Midgley possessed "an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny". Fred Pearce, writing for New Scientist, described Midgley as a "one-man environmental disaster".
Use of leaded gasoline, which he invented, released large quantities of lead into the atmosphere all over the world. High atmospheric lead levels have been linked with serious long-term health problems from childhood, including neurological impairment, and with increased levels of violence and criminality in America and around the world. Time magazine included both leaded gasoline and CFCs on its list of "The 50 Worst Inventions".
Midgley died three decades before the ozone-depleting and greenhouse gas effects of CFCs in the atmosphere became widely known. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol phased out the use of CFCs like Freon.
The harm of leaded gasoline and chlorofluorocarbons have been framed as lessons in known unknowns and unknown unknowns, respectively. When leaded gasoline was invented it was known that lead had harmful effects on human health in large quantities, and that leaded gasoline caused emissions of trace amounts of lead to the atmosphere, but it was not known whether those trace amounts had adverse effects. The existence of the ozone layer, however, and the potential for chlorofluorocarbons to harm it, was not known at the time.
In 2024, it was announced that screenwriter Terence Winter was co-writing a feature film about Midgley entitled Midge.

## 早年生活

米基利于1889年出生在美国宾夕法尼亚州的比弗福尔斯。他在俄亥俄州哥伦布长大，1911年时，从康奈尔大学机械工程专业毕业。他持有一百多项发明专利。他的父亲也是一个发明家。

## 含铅汽油

1916年米基利加入通用汽车旗下的戴顿实验室，在查尔斯·凯特灵（Charles Kettering）手下工作。由于要研究新的汽油抗爆震剂，因此米基利自学了几年化学。1921年12月，米基利发现了一个优良的汽油抗爆剂——四乙基铅。四乙基铅合成容易，价格便宜，而且汽油中只要加入少量的四乙基铅，就能显著提高汽油的抗爆性能。因此四乙基铅受到石油公司和汽车公司的欢迎，特别是当时拥有此项专利的通用汽车公司。含铅汽油也被看作是比乙醇和乙醇混合燃料性能更好且更为便宜的燃料。
铅和部分铅化合物在当时都是已知的毒物，因此米基利在发明四乙基铅后，仅将其称作“乙基”（Ethyl），刻意避免提到铅，以免引起人们的惶恐。
1922年12月，美国化学会授予米基利尼克斯奖章。
随着含铅汽油的推广，四乙基铅在汽油燃烧时产生的铅严重污染了大气，使得世界各地患铅中毒的人急剧增多，大量中毒後的人們陷入暴躁易怒的症狀，都市地區的犯罪率也大幅上升，人们对含铅汽油的质疑也逐渐增加。米基利本人在与有机铅化合物接触一年以后，也不得不给自己放长假，以缓解含铅粉尘对肺的压力。
1923年4月，通用汽车开设了一个下属的化学公司，聘用查尔斯·凯特灵为总裁，米基利为副总裁，专门负责监督当时负责生产四乙基铅的杜邦公司。杜邦公司在生产四乙基铅期间，有两名工人因铅中毒而死亡，数人患病。其他的生产工人因此对四乙基铅怨声连连，要求停止生产这种产品。
尽管如此，通用汽车对杜邦公司的生产效率仍不满意。1924年，通用汽车和标准石油公司共同创办了“乙基汽油公司”，摒弃了杜邦公司生产四乙基铅时用的“溴化物法”，改用需要高温且更为危险的“氯乙烷法”来专门生产四乙基铅。然而，该工厂开始仅两个月，就有五名工人相继因铅中毒而死亡，加深了公众对四乙基铅安全性的怀疑。
10月30日，米基利举办新闻发布会，向公众证明四乙基铅的使用是安全的。会上他以自己为实验对象，先是将四乙基铅洒在他手上，然后打开一瓶四乙基铅，将其放在鼻子下闻了60秒。试验完后的他安然无恙，于是他向媒体说，他就是每天都暴露在这样的环境下，也从来没有发生过任何问题，因此四乙基铅是安全的。讽刺的是，发布会几天后，该工厂就被所在的新泽西州州政府强制关闭；米基利也因為中毒而要送醫治療，並用将近一年的时间才能从这60秒的四乙基铅中缓过来。
含铅汽油在1980年代末期被禁止使用。
含鉛汽油在2021年經聯合國發佈在全世界停產。

## 发现氟利昂

1930年，通用汽车公司又给了米基利另一项任务：研制一种能用于家用电器的无毒、安全的制冷剂。于是他和查尔斯·凯特灵一起，发现了一个性能优良的制冷剂——二氯二氟甲烷。二氯二氟甲烷是氯氟碳化合物（CFC）的一员，米基利将这类化合物称为“氟利昂”，是一类无毒、不可燃且容易液化的气体。此后CFC很快替代了当时一些有毒或有爆炸性的制冷剂，成为最主要的制冷物质。1937年，米基利因此被授予珀金奖章。
1974年时发现了氟利昂对臭氧层的破坏作用。1987年签署的《蒙特利尔议定书》限制了氟利昂的使用。1996年，氟利昂的应用才全面被禁止。

## 晚年生活

1941年，美国化学会授予米基利普利斯特里奖，并于次年授予他威拉德·吉布斯奖。1944年他成为美国化学学会的主席。
1940年，51岁的米基利患上脊髓灰质炎而導致其於移動上有困難，因此他為自己设计了一套绳索滑轮系统以帮他在床上抬身或翻身。1944年，他被该装置中的滑轮绳索缠住，窒息而死，终年55岁。
