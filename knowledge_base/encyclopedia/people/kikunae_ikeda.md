## 摘要

Kikunae Ikeda (池田 菊苗, Ikeda Kikunae; 8 October 1864 – 3 May 1936) was a Japanese chemist and Tokyo Imperial University professor of chemistry who, in 1908, uncovered the chemical basis of a taste he named umami. It is one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, sour and salty.

**中文摘要:**
池田菊苗（日語：池田 菊苗／いけだ きくなえ，羅馬化：Ikeda Kikunae，1864年10月8日—1936年5月3日）是一名日本化學家，東京帝國大學化學教授，日本化學會及帝国学士院會員。他在1908年發現了第五種味覺「鮮味」（うま味）的化學機制及其關鍵活性成分穀胺酸，並於此基礎上發明了穀胺酸鈉味精，因此被譽為「味精之父」。
池田於1889年畢業於東京帝國大學化學系。1891年，他成為東京高等師範學校的教授。1896年，他成為東京帝國大學的副教授。1899年起，池田教授在德國萊比錫大學威廉·奧斯特瓦爾德教授的實驗室學習了兩年，那裡是當時物理化學的中心。在倫敦短暫停留後，他於1901年回國並晉升東京帝國大學化學系的正式教授。
1907年，池田與家人在日本東京帝國大學吃晚飯時突然停了下來。他發現當晚的高湯比平時更美味；在攪拌了幾次後，他意識到這一區別是加入了昆布和鰹魚乾所帶來的鮮美味道。他意識到昆布是這種味道的關鍵食材，並從那天起開始研究昆布的化學成分，終於在1908年成功分離出穀胺酸的棕色晶體穀胺酸鈉（MSG，也叫麩胺酸钠），並發現其傳遞出特有的味道，最終確定其為鮮味的化學基礎，將其命名為味之素。翌年他旋即開發出從小麥和脫脂大豆提取麩胺酸鈉的大規模生產技術，並為此申請專利。此突破性技術成功令全球麩胺酸鈉的產量突飛猛進。
池田同時亦有研究其他食物的鮮味成分，並證實肉類、海藻和番茄等食物均富含帶來鮮味的活性成分穀胺酸，據此歸納出人類很可能擁有對穀胺酸的味覺，因為它標誌著蛋白質的存在。
1985年4月18日，日本特許廳將他選為日本十大發明家之一。時至今日，麩胺酸鈉已被列為僅次於鹽和胡椒的頂級增味劑之一；雖然麩胺酸鈉已現代已改由發酵的玉米澱粉、甘蔗或甜菜中提煉，但其發明仍對味精的發展功不可沒，其創辦的味之素公司亦已發展成大型企業，目前有32,000多名員工。

## 英文全文

## Education

Ikeda graduated in 1889 from Tokyo Imperial University in chemistry. In 1891, he became a professor at the Higher Normal School of Tokyo, in 1896 he became an associate professor at Tokyo Imperial University. From 1899, Prof. Ikeda studied in Germany for two years at the laboratory of Prof. Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald at the University of Leipzig, which was then the center of physical chemistry. After a brief stay in London, he returned to Tokyo in 1901 and became a full professor in chemistry at Tokyo Imperial University.

## Discoveries

In 1907 at the Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, Ikeda was eating dinner with his family when he suddenly stopped. That day the dashi broth in his soup was more delicious than normal; after stirring a few times he realized the difference was the umami flavor from the addition of kombu, a species of brown macroalgae, and flakes of fish known as katsuobushi. He understood that kombu was the secret to that flavor, and from that day on he studied the chemical composition of kelp. Some noted that the taste of the umami is similar to the flavor of the haute cuisine that the French chef Auguste Escoffier created.
By 1908, he had isolated brown crystals of glutamic acid (glutamate) which conveyed the characteristic flavor. The chemical monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the chemical basis for the umami flavor. He chose to call it Ajinomoto (味の素; "essence of flavor"). By 1909 he had developed a process for mass-producing MSG. He was able to extract MSG from wheat and defatted soybean, and patented the process for its manufacture. Today, MSG is mass-produced from fermented cornstarch, sugar cane, molasses, or beet. His Ajinomoto Co., Inc. currently employs over 32,000 people. With this method the global production of MSG increased rapidly. MSG ranks today as one of the top flavor enhancers after salt and pepper.
Kikunae Ikeda also studied other foods to see if they contained umami, and confirmed that glutamate was responsible for part of the flavor of meat, seaweed and tomatoes. He believed that humans likely developed a taste for glutamate because it signaled the presence of proteins.

## Praise

On 18 April 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.
