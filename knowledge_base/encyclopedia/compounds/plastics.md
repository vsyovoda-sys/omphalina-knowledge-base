## 摘要 (Summary)

**English:**
Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semisynthetic materials composed primarily of polymers. Their defining characteristic, plasticity, allows them to be molded, extruded, or pressed into a diverse range of solid forms. This adaptability, combined with a wide range of other properties such as low weight, durability, flexibility, chemical resistance, low toxicity, and low-cost production, has led to their widespread use around the world. While most plastics are produced from natural gas and petroleum, a growing minority are produced from renewable resources like polylactic acid.
Between 1950 and 2017, 9.2 billion metric tons of plastic are estimated to have been made, with more than half of this amount being produced since 2004. In 2023 alone, preliminary figures indicate that over 400 million metric tons of plastic were produced worldwide. If global trends in plastic demand continue, it is projected that annual global plastic production will exceed 1.3 billion tons by 2060. The primary uses for plastic include packaging, which makes up about 40% of its usage, and building and construction, which makes up about 20% of its usage.
The success and dominance of plastics since the early 20th century have had major benefits for mankind, ranging from medical devices to light-weight construction materials. The sewage systems in many countries rely on the resiliency and adaptability of polyvinyl chloride. It is also true that plastics are the basis of widespread environmental concerns, due to their slow decomposition rate in natural ecosystems. Most plastic produced has not been reused. Some are unsuitable for reuse. Much ends up in landfills or as plastic pollution. Particular concern focuses on microplastics. Marine plastic pollution, for example, creates garbage patches. Of all the plastic discarded so far, some 14% has been incinerated and less than 10% has been recycled.
In developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping, plumbing or vinyl siding. Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic), furniture, and toys. In the developing world, the applications of plastic may differ; 42% of India's consumption is used in packaging. Worldwide, about 50 kg of plastic is produced annually per person, with production doubling every ten years.
The world's first fully synthetic plastic was Bakelite, invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland, who coined the term "plastics". Dozens of different types of plastics are produced today, such as polyethylene, which is widely used in product packaging, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used in construction and pipes because of its strength and durability. Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger, who has been called "the father of polymer chemistry", and Herman Mark, known as "the father of polymer physics".

## 英文 Wikipedia 全文

## Etymology

The word plastic derives from the Ancient Greek πλαστικός (plastikos), meaning "capable of being shaped or molded," which itself comes from πλαστός (plastos), meaning "molded" or "formed." In modern usage, the word plastic most commonly refers to the solid synthetic products of petrochemical-derived manufacturing.
The word plasticity, as a noun, specifically refers to the deformability of the materials used in the manufacture of plastics. Plasticity allows molding, extrusion, or compression into a variety of shapes, including films, fibers, plates, tubes, bottles, and boxes, among many others. In materials science, plasticity also has a more technical definition, describing the nonreversible change in form of solid substances when subjected to external forces. However, this definition extends beyond the scope of this article.

## Structure

Most plastics contain organic polymers. The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, with or without the attachment of oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms. These chains comprise many repeating units formed from monomers. Each polymer chain consists of several thousand repeating units. The backbone is the part of the chain that is on the main path, linking together a large number of repeat units. To customize the properties of a plastic, different molecular groups called side chains hang from this backbone; they are usually attached to the monomers before the monomers themselves are linked together to form the polymer chain. The structure of these side chains influences the properties of the polymer.

## Classifications

Plastics are usually classified by their chemical structure of the polymer's backbone and side chains. Important groups classified in this way include the acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and halogenated plastics. Plastics can be classified by the chemical process used in their synthesis, such as condensation, polyaddition, and cross-linking. They can also be classified by their physical properties, including hardness, density, tensile strength, thermal resistance, and glass transition temperature. Plastics can additionally be classified by their resistance and reactions to various substances and processes, such as exposure to organic solvents, oxidation, and ionizing radiation. Other classifications of plastics are based on qualities relevant to manufacturing or product design for a particular purpose. Examples include thermoplastics, thermosets, conductive polymers, biodegradable plastics, engineering plastics and elastomers.

### Thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers

One important classification of plastics is the degree to which the chemical processes used to make them are reversible or not.
Thermoplastics do not undergo chemical change in their composition when heated and thus can be molded repeatedly. Examples include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
Thermosetting polymers, also known as thermosets, can melt and take shape only once: after they have solidified, they stay solid and retain their shape permanently. If reheated, thermosets decompose rather than melt. Examples of thermosets include epoxy resin, polyimide, and Bakelite. The vulcanization of rubber is an example of this process. Before heating in the presence of sulfur, natural rubber (polyisoprene) is a sticky, slightly runny material, and after vulcanization, the product is dry and rigid.

### Commodity, engineering, and high-performance plastics


#### Commodity plastics

Commodity plastics or commodity polymers are plastics produced in high volumes for applications such as packaging, food containers, and household products, including both disposable products and durable goods. In contrast to engineering plastics, commodity plastics tend to be inexpensive to produce and exhibit relatively weak mechanical properties. Widely used commodity plastics include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Products made from commodity plastics include disposable plates, disposable cups, photographic and magnetic tape, clothing, reusable bags, medical trays, and seeding trays.
Approximately 80% of global plastic production includes commodity plastics, a type of plastics primarily chosen for their low cost and ease of manufacturing. These plastics are mass-produced and ubiquitous in packaging, food containers, and single-use items. Most commodity plastics are identifiable by their Resin Identification Codes (RICs), a standardized numbering system developed by ASTM International.

 Polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE)
 High-density polyethylene (HDPE or PE-HD)
 Polyvinyl chloride (PVC or V)
 Low-density polyethylene (LDPE or PE-LD),
 Polypropylene (PP)
 Polystyrene (PS)
Beyond the six most widely recognized listed above, there are more commodity plastics that are also mass-produced and commonly used, such as polyurethanes (PURs). PURs are a class of plastics also designated as commodity plastics due to their low cost, ease of manufacturing, and versatility. However, they lack RICs because they encompass many chemically diverse formulations such as foams and adhesives.
Packaging represents the largest application of commodity plastics, consuming 146 million metric tons (36% of global production) in 2015 alone. Beyond packaging, however, these plastics are critical in various other fields such as agriculture, construction, consumer goods, and healthcare.
Although many traits such as durability and resistance to biodegradability are desirable in various applications, they have led to significant environmental issues. An estimated 8 to 12 million tons of plastic enter oceans annually, primarily from mismanaged packaging waste. Commodity plastics account for the majority of this pollution, as their recycling rates remain low (e.g., only ~9% of all plastics are recycled globally). Microplastics derived from their degradation further threaten ecosystems and human health.
The roughly 20% of remaining plastics are engineering and high-performance plastics, valued for their strength, heat resistance, chemical resistance, and other exceptional qualities. These kinds of plastics are more expensive, less common, and often used in more specialized applications.

#### Engineering plastics

Engineering plastics are more robust and are used to manufacture products such as vehicle parts, building and construction materials, and some machine parts. In some cases, they are polymer blends consisting mixtures of polymers. Engineering plastics can replace metals in vehicles, lowering their weight and improving fuel efficiency by 6–8%. Roughly 50% of the volume of modern cars is made of plastic, but this only accounts for 12–17% of the vehicle weight.

Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS): electronic equipment cases (e.g., computer monitors, printers, keyboards) and drainage pipes
High-impact polystyrene (HIPS): refrigerator liners, food packaging, and vending cups
Polycarbonate (PC): compact discs, eyeglasses, riot shields, security windows, traffic lights, and lenses
Polycarbonate + acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (PC + ABS): a blend of PC and ABS that creates a stronger plastic used in car interior and exterior parts and in mobile phone bodies
Polyethylene + acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (PE + ABS): a slippery blend of PE and ABS used in low-duty dry bearings
Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (acrylic): contact lenses (of the original "hard" variety), glazing (best known in this form by its various trade names around the world; e.g. Perspex, Plexiglas, and Oroglas), fluorescent-light diffusers, and rear light covers for vehicles. It also forms the basis of artistic and commercial acrylic paints, when suspended in water with the use of other agents.
Silicones (polysiloxanes): heat-resistant resins used mainly as sealants but also used for high-temperature cooking utensils and as a base resin for industrial paints
Urea-formaldehyde (UF): one of the aminoplasts used as a multi-colorable alternative to phenolics: used as a wood adhesive (for plywood, chipboard, hardboard) and electrical switch housings

#### High-performance plastics

High-performance plastics are a category of polymers exhibiting superior properties compared to commodity and engineering plastics. These plastics can withstand high temperatures, often above 302°F (150°C), are highly resistant to chemical corrosion and degradation, have excellent mechanical and electric properties, and are lightweight and versatile.

Aramids: best known for their use in the manufacture of body armor, this class of heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers also has applications in aerospace and military and includes Kevlar, Nomex, and Twaron.

Polyetherimide (PEI): a high-temperature, chemically stable polymer that does not crystallize
Polyimide: a high-temperature plastic used in materials such as Kapton tape
Polysulfone (PS): high-temperature melt-processable resin used in membranes, filtration media, water heater dip tubes and other high-temperature applications
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): heat-resistant, low-friction coatings used in non-stick surfaces for frying pans, plumber's tape, and water slides
Polyamide-imide (PAI): high-performance engineering plastic extensively used in high-performance gears, switches, transmissions, and other automotive components and aerospace parts
Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS): extreme chemical resistance, flame retardancy, and thermal stability (up to 428°F).
Polyethersulfone (PES): best known for their clarity, high-temperature resistance (up to 392°F), and biocompatibility. Commonly used in medical devices, food-grade equipment, and aerospace lighting.
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF): a nonreactive thermoplastic fluoropolymer known for extreme chemical resistance, ultraviolet stability, and piezoelectric properties. Commonly used in semiconductor tubing, lithium-ion battery binders, and architectural coatings.
Liquid-crystal polymers (LCPs): a class of polymers combining the properties of both liquids and crystals, known for extreme dimensional stability, low thermal expansion, and high dielectric strength. Commonly used in miniature electronics, fiber-optic cables, and surgical devices.
Polyimides (PIs): a class of high-performance thermosets, able to operate up to 572°F and best known for their excellent dielectric properties and radiation resistance. Commonly used in flexible printed circuits, space suit layers, and jet engine components.
Polybenzimidazole (PBI): extremely high heat resistance (up to 752°F short-term), low outgassing, and flame resistance. Commonly used in firefighting gear, semiconductor tools, and aerospace thermal shields.
Bismaleimide (BMI): known for its high glass transition temperature (around 482°F) and low moisture absorption. Commonly used in composite aircraft matrices and military radar systems.
Cyanate esters: known for their low dielectric loss and space-grade radiation resistance. Commonly used in satellite components and radar antennas.

### Amorphous and crystalline plastics

Many plastics are amorphous, meaning they lack a highly ordered molecular structure. Crystalline plastics exhibit a pattern of more regularly spaced atoms, such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyether ether ketone (PEEK). However, some plastics are partially amorphous and partially crystalline in molecular structure, giving them both a melting point and one or more glass transitions (the temperature above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased). These so-called semi-crystalline plastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes.

### Conductive polymers

Conductive polymers include certain kinds of polyacetylene, which attracted much academic interest. Conductivities as high as 80 kilosiemens per centimeter (kS/cm) have been achieved in such materials, although that value is not comparable to that of copper (60 MS/cm). A practical conductive plastic is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate.

### Biodegradable plastics and bioplastics


#### Biodegradable plastics

Biodegradable plastics are plastics that are designed to degrade (break down) after use.  The most popular such materials are polylactic acids (PLAs), which have the added attraction that they are derived from non-petrochemical, renewable materials.  PLAs have achieved only limited commercial success. upon exposure to biological factors, such as sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, moisture, bacteria, insects, enzymes, or wind abrasion.

#### Bioplastics

While most plastics are produced from petrochemicals, bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials like cellulose and starch. Due both to the finite limits of fossil fuel reserves and to rising levels of greenhouse gases caused primarily by the burning of those fuels, the development of bioplastics is a growing field. Global production capacity for bio-based plastics is estimated at 327,000 tonnes per year. In contrast, global production of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), the world's leading petrochemical-derived polyolefins, was estimated at over 150 million tonnes in 2015.

## Plastic industry

The plastic industry includes the global production, compounding, conversion and sale of plastic products. Although the Middle East and Russia produce most of the required petrochemical raw materials, the production of plastic is concentrated in the global East and West. The plastic industry comprises a huge number of companies and can be divided into several sectors:

### Production

Between 1950 and 2017, 9.2 billion tonnes of plastic are estimated to have been made, with more than half of this having been produced since 2004. Since the birth of the plastic industry in the 1950s, global production has increased enormously, reaching 400 million tonnes a year in 2021; this is up from 381 million metric tonnes in 2015 (excluding additives). From the 1950s, rapid growth occurred in the use of plastics for packaging, in building and construction, and in other sectors. If global trends on plastic demand continue, it is estimated that by 2050 annual global plastic production will exceed 1.1-billion tonnes annually.

Plastics are produced in chemical plants by the polymerization of their starting materials (monomers); which are almost always petrochemical in nature. Such facilities are normally large and are visually similar to oil refineries, with sprawling pipework running throughout. The large size of these plants allows them to exploit economies of scale. Despite this, plastic production is not particularly monopolized, with about 100 companies accounting for 90% of global production. This includes a mixture of private and state-owned enterprises. Roughly half of all production takes place in East Asia, with China being the largest single producer. Major international producers include:

Dow Chemical
LyondellBasell
ExxonMobil
SABIC
BASF
Sibur
Shin-Etsu Chemical
Indorama Ventures
Sinopec
Braskem
Historically, Europe and North America have dominated global plastics production. However, since 2010 Asia has emerged as a significant producer, with China accounting for 31% of total plastic resin production in 2020. Regional differences in the volume of plastics production are driven by user demand, the price of fossil fuel feedstocks, and investments made in the petrochemical industry. For example, since 2010 over US$200 billion has been invested in the United States in new plastic and chemical plants, stimulated by the low cost of raw materials. In the European Union (EU), too, heavy investments have been made in the plastics industry, which employs over 1.6-million people with a turnover of more than 360 billion euros per year. In China in 2016 there were over 15,000 plastic manufacturing companies, generating more than US$366 billion in revenue.
In 2017, the global plastics market was dominated by thermoplastics– polymers that can be melted and recast. Thermoplastics include polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and synthetic fibers, which together represent 86% of all plastics.

### Compounding

Plastic is not sold as a pure unadulterated substance but is instead mixed with various chemicals and other materials. These additives include substances such as stabilizers, plasticizers, and dyes, which are intended to improve the lifespan, workability, or appearance of the final item. In some cases, two types of polymers are combined to form a polymer blend, such as high impact polystyrene. Large companies may do their own compounding prior to production, but some producers have it done by a third party. Companies that specialize in this work are known as Compounders.
The compounding of thermosetting plastic is relatively straightforward; as it remains liquid until it is cured into its final form. For thermosoftening materials, which are used to make the majority of products, it is necessary to melt the plastic in order to mix-in the additives. This involves heating it to anywhere between 150–320 °C (300–610 °F). Molten plastic is viscous and exhibits laminar flow, leading to poor mixing. Compounding is therefore done using extrusion equipment, which is able to supply the necessary heat and mixing to give a properly dispersed product.
The concentrations of most additives are usually quite low, however high levels can be added to create Masterbatch products. The additives in these are concentrated but still properly dispersed in the host resin. Masterbatch granules can be mixed with cheaper bulk polymer and will release their additives during processing to give a homogeneous final product. This can be cheaper than working with a fully compounded material and is particularly common for the introduction of color.

### Converting

Converters (sometimes known as processors) are companies or specialists that fabricate finished plastic products from raw materials, often in the form of resins, pellets, or films.

Injection molding: involves injecting molten plastic into a mold cavity under high pressure. The plastic solidifies in the mold to form the desired shape.
Blow molding: involves heating a plastic tube called a parison and inflating it inside a mold to form hollow products such as bottles and toys.
Rotational molding: involves rotating a mold on two axes while it is heated. Plastic powder is added to the mold and melts and sticks to the walls as the mold is rotated, which forms thick-walled hollow parts such as intermediate bulk containers.
Casting: involves pouring liquid resin into a mold where it solidifies into a predesigned shape.
Film blowing: involves heating a polymer and blowing it into a thin, continuous sheet. Commonly used for making polyethylene and polypropylene films used in packaging.
Spinning: involves transforming a polymer melt or solution into continuous strands
3D printing: involves three-dimensionally printing an object layer by layer following a digital model using computer-aided design software.
For thermosetting materials, the process is slightly different, as the plastics are liquid to begin with and but must be cured to give solid products, but much of the equipment is broadly similar.
The most commonly produced plastic consumer products include packaging made from LDPE (e.g. bags, containers, food packaging film), containers made from HDPE (e.g. milk bottles, shampoo bottles, ice cream tubs), and PET (e.g. bottles for water and other drinks). Together these products account for around 36% of plastics use in the world. Most of them (e.g. disposable cups, plates, cutlery, takeaway containers, carrier bags) are used for only a short period, many for less than a day. The use of plastics in building and construction, textiles, transportation and electrical equipment also accounts for a substantial share of the plastics market. Plastic items used for such purposes generally have longer life spans. They may be in use for periods ranging from around five years (e.g. textiles and electrical equipment) to more than 20 years (e.g. construction materials, industrial machinery).

Plastic consumption differs among countries and communities, with some form of plastic having made its way into most people's lives. North America (i.e. the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA region) accounts for 21% of global plastic consumption, closely followed by China (20%) and Western Europe (18%). In North America and Europe, there is high per capita plastic consumption (94 kg and 85 kg/capita/year, respectively). In China, there is lower per capita consumption (58 kg/capita/year), but high consumption nationally because of its large population.

## Applications

The largest application for plastics is as packaging materials, but they are used in a wide range of other sectors, including: construction (pipes, gutters, door and windows), textiles (stretchable fabrics, fleece), consumer goods (toys, tableware, toothbrushes), transportation (headlights, bumpers, body panels, wing mirrors), electronics (phones, computers, televisions) and as machine parts. In optics, plastics are used to manufacture aspheric lenses.

## Additives

Additives are chemicals blended into plastics to improved their performance or appearance. Additives are therefore one of the reasons why plastic is used so widely. Plastics are composed of chains of polymers. Many different chemicals are used as plastic additives. A randomly chosen plastic product generally contains around 20 additives. The identities and concentrations of additives are generally not listed on products.
In the EU, over 400 additives are used in high volumes. In a global market analysis, 5,500 additives were found. At a minimum, all plastic contains some polymer stabilizers which permit them to be melt-processed (molded) without suffering polymer degradation.Additives in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used widely for sanitary plumbing, can constitute up to 80% of the total volume. Unadulterated plastic (barefoot resin) is rarely sold.

### Leaching

Additives may be weakly bound to the polymers or react in the polymer matrix. Although additives are blended into plastic they remain chemically distinct from it and can gradually leach back out during normal use, when in landfills, or following improper disposal in the environment. Additives may also degrade to form other compounds that could be more benign or more toxic. Plastic fragmentation into microplastics and nanoplastics can allow chemical additives to move in the environment far from the point of use. Once released, some additives and derivatives may persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in organisms. They can have adverse effects on human health and biota. A recent review by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) revealed that out of 3,377 chemicals potentially associated with plastic packaging and 906 likely associated with it, 68 were ranked by ECHA as "highest for human health hazards" and 68 as "highest for environmental hazards".

### Recycling

As additives change the properties of plastics they have to be considered during recycling. Presently, almost all recycling is performed by simply remelting and fabricating used plastic into new items. Additives present risks in recycled products due to their difficulty to remove. When plastic products are recycled, it is highly likely that the additives will be integrated into the new products. Plastic waste, even if it is all of the same polymer type, will contain varying types and amounts of additives. Mixing these together can give a material with inconsistent properties, which can be unappealing to industry. For example, mixing different colored plastics with different plastic colorants together can produce a discolored or brown material and for this reason plastic is usually sorted both by polymer type and color prior to recycling.
Lack of transparency and reporting across the value chain often results in lack of knowledge concerning the chemical profile of the final products. For example, products containing brominated flame retardants have been incorporated into new plastic products. Flame retardants are a group of chemicals used in electronic and electrical equipment, textiles, furniture and construction materials which should not be present in food packaging or child care products. A recent study found brominated dioxins as unintentional contaminants in toys made from recycled plastic electronic waste that contained brominated flame retardants. Brominated dioxins have been found to exhibit toxicity similar to that of chlorinated dioxins. They can have negative developmental effects and negative effects on the nervous system and interfere with mechanisms of the endocrine system.

### Health effects

Plastics have proliferated in part because they are relatively benign. They are not acutely toxic, in large part because they are insoluble and or indigestible owing to their large molecular weight. Their degradation products also are rarely toxic. The same cannot be said about some additives, which tend to be lower molecular weight.
Controversies associated with plastics often relate to their additives, some of which are potentially harmful. For example, some flame retardants, such as octabromodiphenyl ether and pentabromodiphenyl ether, are unsuitable for food packaging. Other harmful additives include cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury (regulated under the Minamata Convention on Mercury), which have previously been used in plastic production, are banned in many jurisdictions. However, they are still routinely found in some plastic packaging, including for food.

#### Poor countries

Additives can also be problematic if waste is burned, especially when burning is uncontrolled or takes place in low-technology incinerators, as is common in many developing countries. Incomplete combustion can cause emissions of hazardous substances such as acid gases and ash, which can contain persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins. 
A number of additives identified as hazardous to humans and/or the environment are regulated internationally. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health or on the environment. The use of bisphenol A (BPA) in plastic baby bottles is banned in many parts of the world but is not restricted in some low-income countries.

#### Animals

In 2023, plasticosis, a new disease caused by the ingestion of plastic waste, was discovered in seabirds. Birds affected with this disease were found to have scarred and inflamed digestive tracts, which can impair their ability to digest food. "When birds ingest small pieces of plastic, they found, it inflames the digestive tract. Over time, the persistent inflammation causes tissues to become scarred and disfigured, affecting digestion, growth and survival."

### Types of additive


## Health effects

Plastics per se have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they have a large molecular weight. They are biochemically inert. Additives in plastic products can be more problematic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like PVC to make them pliable. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the EU has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the US has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child-care articles through the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens (cancer-causing substances). Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.
While a finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of its parent polymers may be toxic. In some cases, small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed. For example, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recognized vinyl chloride, the precursor to PVC, as a human carcinogen.

### Bisphenol A (BPA)

Some plastic products degrade to chemicals with estrogenic activity. The primary building block of polycarbonates, bisphenol A (BPA), is an estrogen-like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food. Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans, dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase the body weight of lab animals' offspring. A more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance, which can lead to inflammation and heart disease. As of January 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is spending $30 million to investigate indications of BPA's link to cancer. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, present in plastic wrap based on PVC, is also of concern, as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell. The EU has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys. In 2009, the US government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic.

## Environmental effects

Estimates differ as to the amount of plastic waste produced in the last century. By one estimate, one billion tons of plastic waste have been discarded since the 1950s. Others estimate a cumulative human production of 8.3-billion tons of plastic, of which 6.3-billion tons is waste, with only 9% getting recycled.
It is estimated that this waste is made up of 81% polymer resin, 13% polymer fibers and 32% additives. In 2018 more than 343 million tons of plastic waste were generated, 90% of which was composed of post-consumer plastic waste (industrial, agricultural, commercial and municipal plastic waste). The rest was pre-consumer waste from resin production and manufacturing of plastic products (e.g. materials rejected due to unsuitable color, hardness, or processing characteristics).
The Ocean Conservancy reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more plastic into the sea than all other countries combined. The rivers Yangtze, Indus, Yellow, Hai, Nile, Ganges, Pearl, Amur, Niger, and Mekong "transport 88% to 95% of the global [plastics] load into the sea."
The presence of plastics, particularly microplastics, within the food chain is increasing. In the 1960s microplastics were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentrations. The long-term effects of plastics in the food chain are poorly understood. In 2009 it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastic, although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile, 50% to 80% of debris in marine areas is plastic. Plastic is often used in agriculture. There is more plastic in the soil than in the oceans. The presence of plastic in the environment hurts ecosystems and human health.
Research on the environmental impacts has typically focused on the disposal phase. However, the production of plastics is also responsible for substantial environmental, health and socioeconomic impacts.
Prior to the Montreal Protocol, CFCs had been commonly used in the manufacture of the plastic polystyrene, the production of which had contributed to depletion of the ozone layer.
Efforts to minimize environmental impact of plastics may include lowering of plastics production and use, waste- and recycling-policies, and the proactive development and deployment of alternatives to plastics such as for sustainable packaging.

### Microplastics


### Decomposition of plastics

Plastics degrade by a variety of processes, the most significant of which are hydrolysis and photo-oxidation. Chemical structure determines the fate of a polymers.   Hence, decomposition pathways can be evaluated according to polymer types of major polymers.  They are by volume: polyolefins (polyethyene, polypropylene, polystyrene), polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In general the degradability of a polymer correlates with the presence of functional groups (esters, amides). Polyolefins, which lack functional groups, degrade very slowly, especially polyethylene.  In the case of polyethylene, degradation is attributed to reactions of defects within the polymer chain, such as alkene groups. PET, a polyester, degrades relatively quickly by multiple pathways, including ester hydrolysis and photooxidation.  Whereas the other main polymers are stable to > 400 °C, PVC degrades at <300 °C.  The process entails loss of hydrogen chloride (HCl). The evolved HCl catalyzes degradation of the PVC, thus much effort is devoted to capturing the HCl by mixing the PVC with additives.
Microbial species capable of degrading plastics are known, but remain curiosities.
Phenol-formaldehyde, commonly known as Bakelite, is degraded by the white rot fungus P. chrysosporium.

### Recycling


#### Pyrolysis

By heating to above 500 °C (932 °F) in the absence of oxygen (pyrolysis), plastics can be broken down into simpler hydrocarbons, which can be used as feedstocks for the fabrication of new plastics. These hydrocarbons can also be used as fuels.

### Greenhouse gas emissions

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, plastic contributed greenhouse gases in the equivalent of 1.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in 2019, 3.4% of global emissions. They say that by 2060, plastic could emit 4.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas a year. The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from fossil gas or petroleum; thus, the production of plastics creates further fugitive emissions of methane when the fossil gas or petroleum is produced. Additionally, much of the energy used in plastic production is not sustainable energy; for example, high temperature from burning fossil gas. However, plastics can also limit methane emissions; for example, packaging to reduce food waste.
A study from 2024 found that compared to glass and aluminum, plastic may actually have less of a negative effect on the environment and therefore might be the best option for must food packaging and other common uses. The study found that, "replacing plastics with alternatives is worse for greenhouse gas emissions in most cases." and that the study involving European researchers found, "15 of the 16 applications a plastic product incurs fewer greenhouse gas emissions than their alternatives."

#### Reducing plastic production as a climate solution

In 2025, for the first time in history almost every country discussed not about just recycling but about reducing plastic production. This can be considered as indispensable part of the solution to the problem of climate change because plastic is responsible for 3-5% of emissions according to the United Nations and the US Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and this can triple by 2060 One of the reasons is that burning of plastics releases black carbon, which has a global warming potential of up to 5,000 times greater than CO2.

### Production of plastics

Production of plastics from crude oil requires 7.9 to 13.7 kWh/lb (taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of 35%). Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming: 29.2 to 29.8 kWh/lb for silicon, and about 381 kWh/lb for semiconductors. This is much higher than the energy needed to produce many other materials. For example, to produce iron (from iron ore) requires 2.5-3.2 kWh/lb of energy; glass (from sand, etc.) 2.3–4.4 kWh/lb; steel (from iron) 2.5–6.4 kWh/lb; and paper (from timber) 3.2–6.4 kWh/lb.

### Incineration of plastics

Quickly burning plastics at very high temperatures breaks down many toxic components, such as dioxins and furans. This approach is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration. Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally treat the flue gas to decrease pollutants further, which is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces carcinogenic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures and normally releases such toxic fumes.
In the European Union, municipal waste incineration is regulated by the Industrial Emissions Directive, which stipulates a minimum temperature of 850 °C for at least two seconds.

### Facilitation of natural degradation

The bacterium Blaptica dubia is claimed to help degradation of commercial polysterene. This biodegradation seems to occur in some plastic degrading bacteria inhabiting the gut of cockroaches. The biodegradation products have been found in their feces too.

## History

The development of plastics has evolved from the use of naturally plastic materials (e.g., gums and shellac) to the use of the chemical modification of those materials (e.g., natural rubber, cellulose, collagen, and milk proteins), and finally to completely synthetic plastics (e.g., bakelite, epoxy, and PVC). Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins, which are organic polymers. In around 1600 BC, Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines. Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages. Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk proteins with lye. In the nineteenth century, as chemistry developed during the Industrial Revolution, many materials were reported. The development of plastics accelerated with Charles Goodyear's 1839 discovery of vulcanization to harden natural rubber.

Parkesine, invented by Alexander Parkes in 1855 and patented the following year, is considered the first man-made plastic. It was manufactured from cellulose (the major component of plant cell walls) treated with nitric acid as a solvent. The output of the process (commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin) could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated. By incorporating pigments into the product, it could be made to resemble ivory. Parkesine was unveiled at the 1862 International Exhibition in London and garnered for Parkes the bronze medal.
In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein (milk proteins) by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as galalith. In 1897, mass-printing press owner Wilhelm Krische of Hanover, Germany, was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards. The resultant horn-like plastic made from casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846–1940). Although unsuitable for the intended purpose, other uses would be discovered.
The world's first fully synthetic plastic was Bakelite, invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland, who coined the term plastics. Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger, who has been called "the father of polymer chemistry", and Herman Mark, known as "the father of polymer physics". After World War I, improvements in chemistry led to an explosion of new forms of plastics, with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s. Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene (first produced by BASF in the 1930s) and polyvinyl chloride (first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s). In 1923, Durite Plastics, Inc., was the first manufacturer of phenol-furfural resins. In 1933, polyethylene was discovered by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett.
The discovery of polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) is credited to employees of the Calico Printers' Association in the UK in 1941; it was licensed to DuPont for the US and ICI otherwise, and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances, resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe. In 1954 polypropylene was discovered by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in 1957. Also in 1954 expanded polystyrene (used for building insulation, packaging, and cups) was invented by Dow Chemical. Since the 1960s, plastic production has surged with the advent of polycarbonate and HDPE, widely used in various products. In the 1980s and 1990s, plastic recycling and the development of biodegradable plastics began to flourish to mitigate environmental impacts. From 2000 to the present, bioplastics from renewable sources and awareness of microplastics have spurred extensive research and policies to control plastic pollution.

## Policy

Work is currently underway to develop a global treaty on plastic pollution. On March 2, 2022, UN Member States voted at the resumed fifth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2) to establish an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) with the mandate of advancing a legally-binding international agreement on plastics. The resolution is entitled "End plastic pollution: Towards an international legally binding instrument." The mandate specifies that the INC must begin its work by the end of 2022 with the goal of "completing a draft global legally binding agreement by the end of 2024."

## 中文 Wikipedia 补充内容

## 熱塑性塑料及热固性塑料

塑料可以依加熱後是否軟化分為兩種，分別是熱塑性塑料及热固性塑料。
熱塑性塑料在加熱後其成份不會有化學變化，因此可以反覆的模塑。這類的塑料包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、聚苯乙烯和聚氯乙烯。常見的熱塑性塑料分子量約在20,000到500,000 amu之間。
热固性塑料只能熔化成型一次，當受热固化定型之後，就無法再重新加熱成型。在热固程序中發生了不可逆的化學反應。像橡膠的硫化就是一種热固程序。在硫化加熱前，橡膠是有黏性、略有流動性的物質，但在硫化後聚異戊二烯變成沒有黏性的固體。像酚醛塑料、脲醛塑料也都是熱固性塑料。热固性塑料的分子量一般假設是無限大。

### 其他分類

其他分類會依在製造或是產品設計有關的特性來分類，例如產量大的通用塑料、彈性體、結構應用（工程塑料，像聚碳酸酯、聚砜、聚苯醚、聚酰胺、聚甲醛等）、生物可分解性或是其導電性等。塑膠也可以依其物理性質分類，例如密度、拉伸强度、玻璃轉化溫度。也有些特殊用途的特种塑料，如医用塑料、导电塑料、耐高温塑料等。

#### 生物可分解性

生物可分解塑膠在暴露在特定自然界的環境條件或生物條件下，會自然分解。特定的條件可能包括暴露在太陽下、遇水或濕氣、細菌、酶、風的磨耗等環境條件（環境分解），也可能是在有囓齒動物，害蟲或昆蟲攻擊等生物條件下。有些型式的塑膠分解需要讓塑膠暴露在陽光下，有些則是要在在垃圾填埋場或堆肥中才會降解。澱粉顆粒曾加在塑膠中以加快其降解，但仍然無法使塑膠完全分解。有些研究者利用基因工程已改良一種細菌，可以合成完全可以生物分解的塑膠，但這種材料（聚羟基丁酸酯）到2013年為止仍非常昂貴。也有公司開發了生物可分解添加物以加速塑膠的分解。

#### 天然及合成

天然塑料包括了天然橡膠、乳胶（可用於製作口香糖）、蟲膠、硝化纤维等，但現今大部份塑料都是石化工業的產物。

#### 生物塑料

由於石油的有限存量以及全球暖化的問題，促使了生物塑料之研發，是来自于可再生的生物质来源的塑料，如来自于植物油，玉米淀粉，豌豆淀粉等。
估計世界上軟包裝材的年消耗量是1230萬噸，其中利用生物相關材料有32.7萬噸。

#### 结晶及无定型

有些塑膠其分子結構為半结晶聚合物，其化學結構一半是晶質，另一半是无定型，因此同時有熔點（克服分子間作用力的溫度）及一個或多個玻璃转化温度（局部的分子彈性显著增加的溫度）。這類的半结晶塑膠包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、聚氯乙烯、聚酰胺、聚酯和某些聚氨酯。
許多塑膠是完全的无定形体，包括聚苯乙烯及其共聚物、聚甲基丙烯酸甲酯及所有熱固性塑膠。也有一些塑膠屬於液晶聚合物。

## 組成

主要包括有機聚合物塑料，絕大多數的這些聚合物的基礎上單獨或與氧，硫，氮以及碳原子鏈。骨幹是鏈上的主要“路徑”，一起把大量的重複單位的一部分。定制塑料，不同的分子團骨幹的“掛起”（通常他們是“掛”作為單體的一部分之前，單體連接在一起，形成高分子鏈）的屬性。這些“側鏈”的結構，影響聚合物的性能。這種重複單元的分子結構的聚合物性能的微調，使塑料成為二十一世紀的世界中不可或缺的一部分。

## 添加劑

大多數塑料含有其他有機或無機化合物，混合添加劑的範圍從零百分比（為用於包裝食品），某些電子應用超過50％的聚合物量。添加劑的平均含量是聚合物重量的20％。填料改善性能和/或降低生產成本。穩定的添加劑包括阻燃劑，降低材料的可燃性。許多塑料中含有填料，相對惰性的，廉價的材料，使產品变得便宜。通常情況下，填料是在原產地的礦產，如粉筆。一些填充物有化學活性，被稱為增強劑。由於許多塑膠經過聚合後硬度極大，難以加工或作為一般材料使用，因此添加塑化劑（或名可塑劑），用來增加柔軟性及彈性。塑化劑是一種常使用的添加劑，但大部分的增塑劑對人體有生殖毒性，至目前為止仍對於塑化劑種類及使用與否有極大的爭議。

## 用途

塑膠的原始目標是用為電絕緣物，自從發現電木以來，屢經改良，塑膠大有助於超高壓的發展和薄膜電子零件的進步。

電器絕緣（例如導線的絕緣層，或電子零件的外殼）
機械材料（因為具有比金屬輕與防鏽蝕的特性）
建築材料與傢俱材質
包裝材料（例如：塑膠袋）
人造纖維（例如：尼龍，聚酯纖維）

## 環保問題

自面世以來，塑料得到廣泛應用，但同時亦產生嚴重的環境問題。塑膠垃圾難以自然分解，導致固體廢物的增加；若流入海洋中，亦會導致海洋生物誤食、窒息、中毒等，影響海洋生態；焚化塑膠垃圾亦會造成空氣污染，部份塑膠，如聚氯乙烯（PVC）和聚碳酸酯（Polycarbonates）在某些條件下或會釋出有害物質或內分泌干擾素，危害生物的生育機能。因此，減少使用塑膠成為環境保護中一項重要的工作。

### 回收分類標籤

為方便塑膠的回收，美國塑膠工業協會（The Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc., USA）提出利用塑料類型來分類的標籤系統：「合成树脂識認碼」（Resin Identification Code，常譯為「塑膠材料編碼」或「塑料編碼」）。可回收的塑膠容器均會附有一個以三個箭號圍繞而成的三角形標籤，標籤上會表示塑料的類型。
中华人民共和国国家标准（GB18455-2001）规定，体积/容积超过100毫升的塑料包装制品或塑料容器必须直观标注塑料回收标示。
但很可惜，塑料的回收並不容易，推行成效亦不理想。與金屬回收比較，塑料回收最大問題是難以用機器進行自動分類，工序牽涉大量人力。除了容器通常以單一塑料造成以外，不少塑膠製品皆以多種不同材料裝配而成，將其解體的成本可能比回收得來的塑料價錢高。而且，部分種類的塑料回收沒有經濟價值，例如發泡膠。這類塑膠垃圾通常會被掩埋或焚化。
其它，如美國回收塑料佔的比重很低，只有5%，但是，德國、北歐等部分國家或地區，則有較高資源回收比重。

### 可分解塑膠

可分解塑膠能於陽光下分解。亦有於塑膠中加入澱粉使其更易於生物分解，但分解仍不完全。亦有人利用基因改造細菌產生完全可生物分解的塑膠，但成本仍高昂。德國巴斯夫公司（BASF）研究出一種稱為Ecoflex的可生物分解塑膠，用於食品包裝。以上的可分解塑膠由於成本問題，因此鮮有使用。而這種塑膠必需曝露於空氣的情況下才能分解，因此若被掩埋，仍然會導致固體廢物的問題。
故此，德國環境部長舒爾茲（Svenja Schulze）2019年9月宣布，計劃明年禁止即棄塑膠袋。而超級市場及零售商的收銀處，將不能向客人提供塑膠袋，包括可生物分解的塑膠袋及採用再生物料製造的塑膠袋在內，違反企業將面臨高達十萬歐元的罰款。

### 塑膠的表面裝飾

一般來說，塑膠製品的表面比較難有變化，因此需要採用噴塗、電鍍等二次加工技術來裝飾表面，增加產品的價值感。不過噴塗、電鍍技術對環境會造成汙染。近幾年出現的IMD技術，因為較傳統二次加工技術更環保，並且可以在塑料射出成型的同時就完成圖案印刷，較省人力與時間成本。IMD技術一般包括三種：IMR（In-Mold Decoration by Roller；模內轉印）、IML（In-Mold Labling；模內標籤）、IMF（薄膜成型）。IMR目前已廣為筆記型電腦與智慧型手機所採用。

### 生態災難

據綠色和平最近的研究顯示，自從2017年12月31日中國收緊洋垃圾進口的禁令起，馬來西亞、泰國和越南迅速成為新的「垃圾崗」。單是2018年，馬來西亞接收近100萬噸，主要來自美國、日本和德國的廢塑膠。此舉令許多亞洲地區的鄉郊淪為塑膠垃圾棄置場，傷害自然環境。

### 其他問題

塑料生產商常在包裝上含糊地稱產品為樹脂，即使明明是人造樹脂/合成樹脂。一般人很易受誤導以為是天然樹脂而放心購買和使用。許多生產商也未有清楚列出製造產品時加入的各式有害化學品。
由於塑料大量生產，價錢便宜，顏色選擇多，所有人們也大量使用塑料用品，以致常在未了解某些塑料的實際特性的情況下不當地使用塑料。例如，有些塑料不宜加熱或用來存放酸性飲品食品，有些塑料不宜受陽光照射等，否則成份會不穩定而釋出。由於無即時危險，以致塑料產品中各種有害物質已從不同途徑，尤其是飲食，進入和污染人體。
