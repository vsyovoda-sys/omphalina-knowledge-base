## 摘要

The Montreal Protocol, officially the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion. It was agreed on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989. Since then it has undergone several amendments and adjustments, with revisions agreed to in 1990 (London), 1992 (Copenhagen), 1995 (Vienna), 1997 (Montreal), 1999 (Beijing), 2007 (Montreal), 2016 (Kigali) and 2018 (Quito). 
The Montreal Protocol has been ratified by 198 parties (197 states and the European Union), making it the first universally ratified treaty in United Nations history. Due to its widespread adoption and implementation, it has been hailed as an example of successful international co-operation. Former United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that "perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol".
As a result of the Protocol, the ozone hole over Antarctica is slowly recovering. Climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2040 across much of the world and 2066 over Antarctica.

## 英文全文

## Terms and purposes

The terms of the Montreal Protocol establish control measures, timelines, assessment and review, data reporting, methods of dealing with non-compliance, and measures to assist developing countries with compliance.
Timelines to phase out production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) covered by the Protocol are grouped by type. Specific ODS compounds belonging to each group are defined in the annexures to the Protocol.
Article 5 of the Protocol creates separate obligations for developing countries, allowing additional time to achieve compliance with the Protocol's control measures. Article 10 of the Protocol establishes a financial mechanism to help those countries achive compliance.

### Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Phase-out Management Plan

The purpose of the Protocol is that each signatory states:

Recognizing that worldwide emissions of certain substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment.  Determined to protect the ozone layer by taking precautionary measures to control equitably total global emissions of substances that deplete it with the ultimate objective of their elimination on the basis of developments in scientific knowledge
Acknowledging that special provision is required to meet the needs of developing countries
shall accept a series of stepped limits on CFC use and production, including:

The substances in Group I of Annex A are:

CFCl3 (CFC-11)
CF2Cl2 (CFC-12)
C2F3Cl3 (CFC-113)
C2F4Cl2 (CFC-114)
C2F5Cl (CFC-115)
For this group, production and consumption in non-Article 5 Parties was frozen (at a 1986 base level) on July 1, 1989, with 75% phasedown by 1994 and complete phase-out by 1996. For Article 5 Parties, consumption and production was frozen (at a base level of the average of 1995–97 amounts), followed by a 50% phasedown by 2005, an 85% phasedown by 2007, and 100% phase-out by 2010. Some chemicals were given individual attention (Carbon tetrachloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane). The phasing-out of the less damaging HCFCs only began in 1996 and will go on until a complete phasing-out is achieved by 2030.
Production and consumption levels of Annex A - Group II Halons (halon-1211, -2404, and -1301) in non-Article 5 Parties was frozen (at a 1986 base level) on January 1, 1992, with complete phase-out by 1994. For Article 5 Parties, production and consumption were frozen (at a base level of the average of 1995–97 amounts) on January 1, 2002, followed by a 50% phasedown by 2005 and complete phase-out by 2010. 
The phasedown and phase-out schedules include a few exceptions for "essential uses" where no acceptable substitutes were initially found (for example, metered dose inhalers commonly used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were previously exempt). Another exception was made for Halon fire suppression systems used in submarines and aircraft (but not in general industry).
The provisions of the Protocol include the requirement that the Parties to the Protocol base their future decisions on the current scientific, environmental, technical, and economic information that is assessed through panels drawn from the worldwide expert communities. To provide that input to the decision-making process, advances in understanding on these topics were assessed in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998 and 2002 in a series of reports entitled Scientific assessment of ozone depletion, by the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP).
In 1990, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol established a Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) as a technology and economics advisory body. The TEAP provides, at the request of Parties, technical information related to alternative technologies that have made it possible to virtually eliminate the use of ODSs that harm the ozone layer. The TEAP is also tasked by the Parties every year to assess and evaluate various technical issues, including evaluating nominations for essential use exemptions for CFCs and halons, and nominations for critical use exemptions for methyl bromide. TEAP's annual reports are a basis for the Parties' informed decision-making.
Numerous reports have been published by various inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations to catalogue and assess alternatives to the ozone depleting substances, since the substances have been used in various technical sectors, like in refrigeration, air conditioning, flexible and rigid foam, fire protection, aerospace, electronics, agriculture, and laboratory measurements.

### Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP)

Under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, especially Executive Committee (ExCom) 53/37 and ExCom 54/39, parties to this protocol agreed to set 2013 as the year to freeze the consumption and production of HCFCs for developing countries. For developed countries, reduction of HCFC consumption and production began in 2004 and 2010, respectively, with 100% reduction set for 2020.  Developing countries agreed to start reducing their consumption and production of HCFCs by 2015, with 100% reduction set for 2030.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, commonly known as HCFCs, are a group of human-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon. They are not found anywhere in nature. HCFC production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of CFCs in the 1980s, which were found to be destroying the ozone layer. Like CFCs, HCFCs are used for refrigeration, aerosol propellants, foam manufacture and air conditioning. Unlike the CFCs, however, most HCFCs are broken down in the lowest part of the atmosphere and pose a much smaller risk to the ozone layer. Nevertheless, HCFCs are very potent greenhouse gases, despite their very low atmospheric concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (ppt).
The HCFCs are transitional CFCs replacements, used as refrigerants, solvents, blowing agents for plastic foam manufacture, and fire extinguishers. In terms of ozone depletion potential (ODP), in comparison to CFCs that have ODP 0.6–1.0, these HCFCs have lower ODPs (0.01–0.5). In terms of global warming potential (GWP), in comparison to CFCs that have GWP 4,680–10,720, HCFCs have lower GWPs (76–2,270).

### Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)

On 1 January 2019, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol came into force. Under the Kigali Amendment countries promised to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years. By 27 December 2018, 65 countries had ratified the Amendment. As of 31 October 2024, 160 states and the European Union have ratified the Amendment.
Produced mostly in developed countries, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) replaced CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs pose no harm to the ozone layer because, unlike CFCs and HCFCs, they do not contain chlorine. They are, however, greenhouse gases, with a high global warming potential (GWP), comparable to that of CFCs and HCFCs. In 2009, a study calculated that a fast phasedown of high-GWP HFCs could potentially prevent the equivalent of up to 8.8 Gt CO2-eq per year in emissions by 2050. A proposed phasedown of HFCs was hence projected to avoid up to 0.5C of warming by 2100 under the high-HFC growth scenario, and up to 0.35C under the low-HFC growth scenario. Recognizing the opportunity presented for fast and effective phasing down of HFCs through the Montreal Protocol, starting in 2009 the Federated States of Micronesia proposed an amendment to phase down high-GWP HFCs, with the U.S., Canada, and Mexico following with a similar proposal in 2010.
After seven years of negotiations, in October 2016 at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted the Kigali Amendment whereby the Parties agreed to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. The amendment to the Montreal Protocol commits the signatory parties to reduce  their HFC production and consumption by at least 85 per cent from the annual average value in the period from 2011 to 2013. A group of developing countries including China, Brazil and South Africa are mandated to reduce their HFC use by 85 per cent of their average value in 2020–22 by the year 2045. India and some other developing countries – Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and some oil economies like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – will cut down their HFCs by 85 per cent of their values in 2024–26 by the year 2047.
On 17 November 2017, ahead of the 29th Meeting of the Parties of the Montreal Protocol, Sweden became the 20th Party to ratify the Kigali Amendment, pushing the Amendment over its ratification threshold ensuring that the Amendment would enter into force 1 January 2019.

### Recent Activities

The Parties to the Montreal Protocol, guided by the SAP, EEAP, and TEAP expert groups, continue to address ozone and climate challenges through Meetings of the Parties (MOP) to the Montreal Protocol, combined Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention (COP)-MOP meetings, and Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) meetings. Recent areas of focus and activities include:

COP 12(I)/MOP 32 (2020): Replenishment of the MLF; critical-use exemptions for methyl bromide
COP 12(II)/MOP 33 (2021): Trading of soon-to-be-obsolete technologies; energy-efficiency requirements; Parties' reporting and compliance
OEWG 44 (2022): Study for replenishment of the MLF for 2024–26; continued emissions of CTC; African Parties' proposal to address the dumping of new but inefficient and obsolete cooling equipment in Africa
MOP 34 (2022): illegal import of HVAC and other cooling equipment; gaps in global atmospheric monitoring of substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol; HFC-23 by-product emissions; illegal trade
OEWG 45 (2023): illegal import and export of HVAC and other cooling equipment; stratospheric aerosol injection; HFC-23 emissions; very short-lived substances (VSLS) with climate- or ozone-damaging potential
MOP 35 (2023): Decisions on MLF replenishment; feedstock uses of methyl bromide; import and export of prohibited cooling equipment (see entry on environmental dumping)
OEWG 46 (2024): Feedstock uses of controlled substances; management of recovered/recycled/reclaimed halons; metered-dose inhalers with low-GWP propellants; improving access to climate-friendly cooling equipment in Article 5 Parties
COP 13/MOP 36 (2024): Decisions on HFC-23 emissions and data reporting forms; LRM; VSLS; feedstocks; enhancing regional and global atmospheric monitoring; avoiding imports of energy-inefficient cooling products.

## History

In the 1970s, the chemists Frank Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina at the University of California, Irvine began studying the impacts of CFCs in the Earth's atmosphere. They discovered that CFC molecules were stable enough to remain in the atmosphere until they rose to the middle of the stratosphere, where they would be broken down by ultraviolet radiation and release a chlorine atom. Rowland and Molina then proposed that these chlorine atoms might be expected to cause the breakdown of large amounts of ozone (O3) in the stratosphere. In 1976, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis.
In 1982, representatives from 24 countries met in Stockholm, Sweden to decide on a "Global Framework Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer." The following year, a group of countries, including the United States, Canada, the Nordic Countries, and Switzerland, proposed a worldwide ban on "nonessential" uses of CFCs in spray cans.
In 1985, British Antarctic Survey scientists Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jon Shanklin published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above Halley Bay near the South Pole. They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. This unforeseen phenomenon in the Antarctic, as well as NASA's scientific images of the ozone hole played an important role in the Montreal Protocol negotiations. The impact of these studies, the metaphor 'ozone hole', and the colorful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada to take the issue seriously.

Also in 1985, 20 nations, including most major CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention, which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. From the discovery of the ozone hole, it only took 18 months to reach a binding agreement in Montreal, Canada. Mostafa Kamal Tolba, the head of the UNEP at the time, was considered the "father of the Montreal Protocol" for his role in bringing the nations together for an agreement.
In 1986, an assessment spearheaded by NASA and sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program, the World Meteorological Organization, and various other organizations concluded that continued CFC emissions at the 1980 rate would "reduce global average ozone by about 9 percent by the latter half of the century." Based on these figures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that in the United States alone there could be "over 150 million new cases of skin cancer among people currently alive and born by the year 2075, resulting in over 3 million deaths."
The CFC industry continued pushing back against regulation as late as 1986, when the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (an association representing the CFC industry founded by DuPont) was still arguing that the science was too uncertain to justify any action. In 1987, DuPont testified before the US Congress that "We believe there is no imminent crisis that demands unilateral regulation." And even in March 1988, Du Pont Chair Richard E. Heckert would write in a letter to the United States Senate, "we will not produce a product unless it can be made, used, handled and disposed of safely and consistent with appropriate safety, health and environmental quality criteria. At the moment, scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic CFC emission reductions. There is no available measure of the contribution of CFCs to any observed ozone change..."
In an unexpected policy change, however, the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy issued a statement in 1986 declaring that "large future increases...in CFCs...would be unacceptable to future generations," and that it would be "inconsistent with [industry] goals...to ignore the potential for risk to future generations." Three months before the protocol negotiations began, U.S. industry announced its support for new international controls on CFCs.

## Multilateral Fund

The main objective of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol is to assist developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol whose annual per capita consumption and production of ozone depleting substances (ODS) is less than 0.3 kg to comply with the control measures of the Protocol. Currently, 147 of the 196 Parties to the Montreal Protocol meet these criteria (they are referred to as Article 5 countries).
It embodies the principle agreed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 that countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to protect and manage the global commons.
The Fund is managed by an executive committee with an equal representation of seven industrialized and seven Article 5 countries, which are elected annually by a Meeting of the Parties. The Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the Parties on its operations. The work of the Multilateral Fund on the ground in developing countries is carried out by four Implementing Agencies, which have contractual agreements with the executive committee:

United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through its OzonAction Programme.
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
World Bank.
Up to 20 percent of the contributions of contributing parties can also be delivered through their bilateral agencies in the form of eligible projects and activities.
The fund is replenished on a three-year basis by the donors. Pledges amount to US$3.1 billion over the period 1991 to 2005. Funds are used, for example, to finance the conversion of existing manufacturing processes, train personnel, pay royalties and patent rights on new technologies, and establish national ozone offices.

## Parties

As of October 2022, all Member States of the United Nations, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Holy See, the State of Palestine as well as the European Union have ratified the original Montreal Protocol, with the State of Palestine being the last party to ratify the agreement, bringing the total to 198. 197 of those parties (with the exception of the State of Palestine) have also ratified the London, Copenhagen, Montreal, and Beijing amendments.

## Effect

Since the Montreal Protocol came into effect, the atmospheric concentrations of the most important chlorofluorocarbons and related chlorinated hydrocarbons have either leveled off or decreased. Halon concentrations have continued to increase, as the halons presently stored in fire extinguishers are released, but their rate of increase has slowed and their abundances are expected to begin to decline by about 2020. Also, the concentration of the HCFCs increased drastically at least partly because of many uses (e.g. used as solvents or refrigerating agents) CFCs were substituted with HCFCs. While there have been reports of attempts by individuals to circumvent the ban, e.g. by smuggling CFCs from undeveloped to developed nations, the overall level of compliance has been high. Statistical analysis from 2010 show a clear positive signal from the Montreal Protocol to the stratospheric ozone. In consequence, the Montreal Protocol has often been called the most successful international environmental agreement to date. In a 2001 report, NASA found the ozone thinning over Antarctica had remained the same thickness for the previous three years, however in 2003 the ozone hole grew to its second largest size. The most recent (2006) scientific evaluation of the effects of the Montreal Protocol states, "The Montreal Protocol is working: There is clear evidence of a decrease in the atmospheric burden of ozone-depleting substances and some early signs of stratospheric ozone recovery." However, a more recent study seems to point to a relative increase in CFCs due to an unknown source.
Reported in 1997, significant production of CFCs occurred in Russia for sale on the black market to the EU throughout the 90s. Related US production and consumption was enabled by fraudulent reporting due to poor enforcement mechanisms. Similar illegal markets for CFCs were detected in Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong.
The Montreal Protocol is also expected to have effects on human health. A 2015 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the protection of the ozone layer under the Protocol will prevent over 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the United States.
However, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, contribute to anthropogenic global warming. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, these compounds are up to 10,000 times more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phase-out of HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs. Since the CFCs themselves are equally powerful greenhouse gases, the mere substitution of HFCs for CFCs does not significantly increase the rate of anthropogenic climate change, but over time a steady increase in their use could increase the danger that human activity will change the climate.
Policy experts have advocated for increased efforts to link ozone protection efforts to climate protection efforts. Policy decisions in one arena affect the costs and effectiveness of environmental improvements in the other.
With the agreement in 2016 of the Kigali Amendment that phases down production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the Montreal Protocol became both an ozone and a climate treaty because HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases. 
In comparison to other environmental treaties, effective burden-sharing and solution proposals mitigating regional conflicts of interest have been among the success factors for the ozone depletion challenge, where global regulation based on the Kyoto Protocol has failed to do so. In this case of the ozone depletion challenge, there was global regulation already being implemented before a scientific consensus was established. Also, overall public opinion was convinced of possible imminent risks.

### Regional detections of non-compliance

In 2018, scientists monitoring the atmosphere following the 2010 phaseout date reported evidence of continuing industrial production of CFC-11, likely in eastern Asia, with detrimental global effects on the ozone layer. A monitoring study detected fresh atmospheric releases of carbon tetrachloride from China's Shandong province, beginning sometime after 2012, and accounting for a large part of emissions exceeding global estimates under the Montreal Protocol.

## 25th anniversary celebrations

The year 2012 marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol. Accordingly, the Montreal Protocol community organized a range of celebrations at the national, regional and international levels to publicize its considerable success to date and to consider the work ahead for the future.
Among its accomplishments are: 

The Montreal Protocol was the first international treaty to address a global environmental regulatory challenge;
the first to embrace the "precautionary principle" in its design for science-based policymaking;
the first treaty where independent experts on atmospheric science, environmental impacts, chemical technology, and economics, reported directly to parties, without edit or censorship, functioning under norms of professionalism, peer review, and respect;
the first to provide for national differences in responsibility and financial capacity to respond by establishing a multilateral fund for technology transfer; the first MEA with stringent reporting, trade, and binding chemical phase-out obligations for both developed and developing countries; and,
the first treaty with a financial mechanism managed democratically by an executive board with equal representation by developed and developing countries.
Within 25 years of signing, parties to the MP celebrate significant milestones. Significantly, the world has phased-out 98% of the Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS) contained in nearly 100 hazardous chemicals worldwide; every country is in compliance with stringent obligations; and, the MP has achieved the status of the first global regime with universal ratification; even the newest member state, South Sudan, ratified in 2013. UNEP received accolades for achieving global consensus that "demonstrates the world’s commitment to ozone protection, and more broadly, to global environmental protection".

## 中文补充

## 议定书主要内容及沿革

议定书的主要内容和修订情况如下：

### 1987年版本

蒙特婁議定書中對CFC-11、CFC-12、CFC-113、CFC-114、CFC-115等五項氟氯碳化物及三項海龍的生產做了嚴格的管制規定，並規定各國有共同努力保護臭氧層的義務，凡是對臭氧層有不良影響的活動，各國均應採取適當防治措施，影響的層面涉及電子光學清洗劑、冷氣機、發泡劑、噴霧劑、滅火器......等等。各国还应当定期召开大会及报告淘汰消耗臭氧层物质的数量和进度，并以法规等手段促进代替CFC等物质的替代品和替代技术的研发。此外，議定書还要求各国考虑采用何种机制实现在技术援助方面的合作。

### 第一次调整案及伦敦修正案

議定書中雖然規定將氟氯碳化物的生產凍結在1986年的規模，並要求已開發國家在1988年減少50%的製造，同時自1994年起禁止海龍的生產。但是1988年的春天，美國太空總署發表了「全球臭氧趨勢報告」，報告中指出全球遭破壞的臭氧層並不僅止於南極與北極的上空，也間接證實了蒙特婁議定書對於氟氯碳化物的管制仍嫌不足。
聯合國有鑑於此，便於1990年6月在英國倫敦召開蒙特婁議定書締約國第二次會議，並對議定書內容作了大幅之修正，其中最為重要者即為擴大列管物質，除原有列管项目之外，另增加CFC-13等10種物質、四氯化碳以及三氯乙烷，共計12種化學物質，並要求加速提前於2000年完全禁用CFC和海龙（附件A第1组、第二组和附件B第一组）等物質

### 第二次调整案及哥本哈根修正案

哥本哈根修正案将34种氢溴氟烃加入受控物质清单中，不再称氢氯氟烃为过渡物质，要求已开发国家和发展中国家分别在2030年和2040年之前停止氢氯氟烃的生产和使用，并强化了各缔约方向议定书缔约方大会秘书处报送受控物质数据的要求。调整案则是将已开发国家氯氟烃和海龙的生产消费停止期限提前了4年。

### 第三次调整案

第三次调整案于1995年12月在维也纳召开的第七次缔约方大会上通过。调整案的主要内容是提出甲基溴淘汰的时间表，允许发展中国家推迟10年完成CFC和海龙等物质的淘汰。

### 第四次调整案及蒙特利尔修正案

蒙特利尔修正案的主要内容是对禁止缔约方向非缔约方出口各类消耗臭氧层物质，并建立进出口许可证制度以监督和约束缔约方之间的管控物质进出口活动。调整案则将甲基溴的淘汰期限从原来的2010年/2020年提前到2005年/2015年。

### 第五次调整案及北京修正案

北京修正案将溴氯甲烷加入管控物质清单中，规定了氢氯氟烃的进出口限制。调整案则调整了CFC类物质的淘汰时间表。

### 第六次调整案

2007年9月通过的第6次调整案将氢氯氟烃的淘汰年限提前了10年，规定发达国家和发展中国家分别应当在2030和2040年之前实现氢氯氟烃的完全淘汰。

## 簽訂歷程

1987年9月，美國及其他23個國家簽署了「蒙特婁議定書」——一份國際間對臭氧層問題的協議。議定書中規定將氟氯碳化物的生產凍結在1986年的規模，並在1988年前於工業國家中減少50%的製造，以及凍結海龍的生產。但是1988年的春天，美國太空總署發表「全球臭氧趨勢報告」，顯示出全球的臭氧層並不僅止於在一般宣稱的南北極地區的上空有被侵蝕的現象。證實了蒙特婁議定書中對氟氯碳化物的逐步汰換，其實是太少而且太晚了些。
1989年5月，在聯合國的發起下，80個國家代表齊聚赫爾辛基，正式通過一項宣言，其中同意儘早將蒙特婁議定書中列管的化學物質逐步汰換，但是絕不晚於2000年。
瑞典是第一個跨越書面背書，且加速進行廢除使用氟氯碳化物時間表的國家。1988年6月，瑞典國會通過在1995年禁用氟氯碳化物的立法。經過與工業界廣泛的討論後，瑞典政府訂定逐步汰換冷凍滅菌劑和在1988年以前仍可繼續使用氟氯碳化物噴劑的時間表，其用於包裝的年限為1989年；溶劑及泡綿的使用年限為1991年，其用於硬泡綿、乾洗及冷卻劑的最晚年限為1994年。瑞典使用氟氯碳化物的量，其實僅佔全世界的1%使用量，所以對其他的國家而言，尤其那些大宗使者，是急需將瑞典視為主要典範來學習追隨的。
環境主義者確信，氟氯碳化物與海龍的放射物可以藉氟氯碳化物的回收再製，與替代化學物的使用而降低極高的百分比。

## 影響


### 工業界

各种消耗臭氧层物质曾广泛地在制冷空调、泡沫、清洗、农业、消防等行业使用。蒙特利尔议定书的签署意味着各缔约方境内的相关行业都需要进行技术研发和生产线改造，以改变依赖消耗臭氧层物质的生产工艺或产品。按照议定书的规定，已开发国家需要主动进行产业改造，并通过多边基金机制，对发展中国家的技术和资金需求提供必要的援助。发展中国家自身及其产业也需要投入资金和研发力量进行消耗臭氧层物质的替代。
在家用制冷行业，冰箱曾普遍使用CFC-12作为制冷剂，CFC-11作为热绝缘材料的发泡剂。CFC-12制冷剂的替代方案主要有两种，即使用HFC-134a或异丁烷（ASHRAE编号R600a）作为制冷剂。HFC-134a在美国和欧洲应用较早，并影响了其他国家如日本的替代技术路线。但HFC-134a对生产线配套设备投资要求高，维修难度大，并不适合技术水平较低的发展中国家使用。异丁烷在欧洲一些企业中得到应用，并被德国介绍到中国冰箱制造业(海爾集團)，作为主要的替代技术，但由于安全充注量的限制而不能用于大型冰箱。发泡剂方面，美国等国家曾使用HCFC-141b作为过渡替代物，但在德国、意大利等欧洲国家的影响下，环戊烷发泡已成为冰箱绝缘层制造中的主流技术，HCFC-141b的使用正在随着议定书规定的时间表逐渐停止。
房间空调器行业中，已开发国家和发展中国家都曾使用HCFC-22作为主要的替代CFC-12的制冷剂，在哥本哈根修正案要求淘汰HCFC-22之后，美国转为使用R410A（HFC-32和HFC-125以1:1比例混合得到的制冷剂），中国和印度等发展中国家则使用R290（即丙烷）作为主要的替代制冷剂。在制冷量较大的机型中，由于R290的可燃性和随之而来的充灌量限制，只能使用R410A制冷剂，但R410A的GWP值高，未来使用可能受到联合国气候变化框架公约的限制，因此业界正在寻找该方面用途的替代品。
发展中国家的工商制冷/空调行业曾普遍以HCFC作为过渡替代品。从2010年开始，这些国家逐渐启动了寻找新物质替代HCFC的工作。由于行业产品的细分化，替代品的选择需要综合考虑安全、环境、系统相容性等因素。目前使用较广的HCFC替代品包括HFC-32、HFC-134a、R410A、氨、二氧化碳等。
泡沫行业因蒙特利尔议定书的限制，从原来使用的CFC-11和HCFC-141b发泡剂转向环戊烷或HFC-245fa发泡剂。这两种发泡技术均可生产出性能接近于原来水平的泡沫产品，但环戊烷技术的阻燃性能不足和HFC的高GWP值促使业界继续探寻更好的替代技术，水/甲酸甲酯技术和二氧化碳技术都是目前研究较多的替代技术。
清洗行业除了以HFC-245fa替代CFC、HCFC类清洗剂以外，也进行多种物理和化学清洗方式的研发。由于清洗工艺涉及的产品和行业众多，清洗行业CFC和HCFC的替代呈现出更加多样化的特点。基于水基清洗剂的清洗、超声清洗、激光清洗等手段都被应用。
药用气雾剂行业可分为吸入类和非吸入类两个子行业，两个子行业均使用HFC-134a和HFC-227作为主要的替代物，在非吸入类气雾剂替代中二甲醚、异丁烷和惰性压缩气体也是常见的替代品。
过去以生产CFC、HCFC等产品为主要业务的氟化工产业受蒙特利尔议定书的影响，转而进行主要替代品种类之一的HFC类产品的生产。由于HFC开发难度高，投入很大，不少企业采用申请专利的手段保护其研究成果，如HFC-134a和HFO-1234yf都处于专利保护下。各国氟化工企业因此都十分重视具有自主知识产权的替代品研究。
各相关行业在履行蒙特利尔议定书，淘汰消耗臭氧层物质的过程中，均有可能遇到替代品工业性质逊于被替代物质，成本升高或者产生其他环境影响的情况。这些问题可通过相关产品的优化设计、对环境风险的管控而得到解决，也可能随着替代品应用规模的增大而得以缓解。但替代品的开发和应用仍然将是各行业在未来一段时期内需要关注的问题。

### 個人

臭氧层的破坏导致到达地面的紫外线辐射增强，引起白内障、皮肤癌等疾病，因此蒙特利尔议定书下的臭氧层保护活动可对个人的健康产生积极的影响。例如，根据美国环保署的估计，由于议定书的实施，约100万美国人可避免在2055-2100年之间由于患皮肤癌而死亡。
在消耗臭氧层物质被淘汰后，由于其用途被限制，产能减小，一般来说这些物质的市场价格会上升。仍然在使用这些物质的个人可能会因价格波动，而需要为继续保有现有的设备付出更多成本。
